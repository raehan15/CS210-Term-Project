#Spotify Project

Explore the intriguing world of personal music preferences and listening habits with my CS210 - Introduction to Data Science project. This endeavor delves into my musical world, analyzing my favorite artists, songs, preferred languages, and daily listening patterns. The central hypothesis of my investigation is a seemingly simple yet personal question: Do I indulge in music more during the relaxed aura of weekends compared to the bustling weekdays?

Utilizing data meticulously extracted from Spotify, encompassing my streaming history over the past year, I embarked on a journey of discovery, harnessing Python's pandas library for efficient data management. The data, already in pristine condition, required no additional cleaning, allowing me to dive straight into the heart of analysis.

My initial steps were to unravel the artists and songs that resonated with me the most. Through careful grouping and sorting, I discovered 'Anuv Jain' topping my list, his melodies offering a soothing escape. A visual representation through a bar graph not only confirmed my affinity for his music but also revealed a predominant inclination towards Urdu songs, hinting at my cultural roots.

The core of my project was to test my hypothesis about my weekend versus weekday listening habits. By categorizing each song play into either a weekend or weekday bucket and employing visual tools like line and bar charts, I initially found weekdays dominating my listening time. However, this observation needed a deeper analysis considering the uneven distribution of days. Thus, I calculated the average listening time per day for both categories. The results were intriguing but inconclusive until a statistical test (Mann-Whitney U) provided the decisive moment, leading to a surprising conclusion.

This project was more than an academic exercise; it was a journey into self-awareness, revealing my inclination towards cultural music and its role as a constant companion, especially during study sessions. It has set the stage for future explorations, where I aim to dive deeper with a richer dataset, uncovering more facets of my musical identity. This exploration is not just about data; it's a narrative of personal tastes, cultural ties, and the rhythm of everyday life.
